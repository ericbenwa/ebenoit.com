<h1>Eric Benoit</h1>
<h2>Creative Director</h2>
<p>At <%= link_to 'Involution Studios', 'http://www.goinvo.com/' %>, I help companies make their products best-in-class through design.</p>

<%= image_tag 'images/eric-benoit-ux-designer.jpg', :alt =>'Eric Benoit Boston Product Designer' %>

<p>The following examples are a glimpse into the holistic view I take on product design.</p>

<h1>Learn</h1>
<h2>The Domain</h2>
<p>I routinely work in domains of which I am not an expert but must quickly get up to speed. Itâ€™s important that I ground myself in the history of the domain, players in the field, lingo, and its future. In addition to traditional methods of learning, I connect with industry experts for 1-on-1 lessons.</p>

<p class="caption">To better understand In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), I made an appointment with the a clinic as a parent wanting to have a child through IVF.</p>

<h2>The Problem Space</h2>
<p>Throughout a project, I use a variety of methods to explore, understand, and codify complex problems.</p>

<h3>Product Architecture</h3>
<p>A group exercise with key stakeholders for documenting the full set of functionality for a product. This helps the group understand and rally around a set of functionality. Arguments to be expected.</p>

<h3>Process Map</h3>
<p>By mapping out all parts of the process, even for the parts not being designed, one gets to understand the entire lifecycle of how a person uses the service.</p>

<%= image_tag 'images/mountsinai_caas_process_v03.png', :alt =>'Mount Sinai Process Map', :class => 'caption' %>

<h3>System Model</h3>
<p>Architecting the main components of the service, relationships, and actions.</p>

<h3>Customer Research</h3>
<p>From understanding customer needs to vetting designs.</p>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>I've led and designed products from birth to launch. I provide vision, strategy, and design for the products companies are betting their success on.</p>

<h1>Build</h1>

<h3>Prototypes</h3>
<p>Ranging from basic clickthroughs to something more dynamic like connecting to a service, a prototype is a requirement for designing any product. I've used the various prototyping tools like InVision, Flinto, Framer Studio, and plain ol' HTML/CSS/JS, depending on the goal of the prototype.
</p>

<h3>Mock Data</h3>
<p>Writing mock data helps communicate with engineering by clearly documenting the expected data, scalability, and nomenclature.</p>
